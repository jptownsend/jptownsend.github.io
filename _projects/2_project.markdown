Ctenophores in coastal waters are top-class predators, but the diet of ctenophores in the open ocean and the deep sea remains unclear. How much do these animals eat? What is their contribution to global ocean carbon cycling? And just how varied are their diets, actually? I'm using DNA metabarcoding of gut contents collected <i>in situ</i> to try to find out.
