I'm a scientist who is fascinated by living things and the adaptations that help them survive and thrive. Each animal and plant alive today represents a uniquely successful approach to "making it" in the world, and I aspire to understand and share their stories. I use a variety of techniques, including spectroscopy, microscopy, mathematical modeling, and DNA sequencing to help make sense of their diverse lives.

Much of my work has been focused on the physiology and ecology of ctenophores. The diet of these peculiar and oft-overlooked, jellyfish-like animals may help us to better understand open ocean carbon cycling and ctenophores' unique system for capturing prey may inspire new kinds of powerful medical adhesives. Among the oldest of animal lineages, the study of ctenophores also raises many important questions about our understanding of evolution, and continues to spur methodological debates therein.
