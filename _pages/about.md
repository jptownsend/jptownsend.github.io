I'm a biophysicist who's fascinated by marine invertebrates and the adaptations that make them unique. I'm eager to share opportunities to learn more about these often overlooked critters with the world. I use a variety of techniques, including spectroscopy, microscopy, mathematical modeling, and DNA sequencing to shed light on the animals I find, by ship, SCUBA, or on the shore.

Much of my work is focused on the physiology and ecology of ctenophores. The diet of these peculiar and oft-overlooked, jellyfish-like animals may help us to better understand open ocean carbon cycling and ctenophores' unique system for capturing prey may inspire new kinds of powerful medical adhesives.
